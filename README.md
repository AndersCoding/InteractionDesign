# PopTerr – Interaction Design Exam Project

This repository contains documentation and design for the exam project **PopTerr**, developed in the course *Interaction Design* (DS3302 1 23H) at Kristiania University College (Fall 2023).

## 📖 About the Project
**PopTerr** (Populus Terrebis – "afraid of people") is a conceptual clothing shopping app.  
It is designed for people with **social anxiety** or discomfort with traditional shopping, combining **gamification** with the shopping experience.  

Users create an avatar, set up a shopping list, and are sent on a "shopping mission." After completing the mission, they earn virtual **PopTerr coins**, which can be redeemed for discounts and rewards.

## 🎯 Goals
- Make shopping a more positive and engaging experience.  
- Support people with social anxiety or physical challenges.  
- Motivate users through game mechanics and rewards.
